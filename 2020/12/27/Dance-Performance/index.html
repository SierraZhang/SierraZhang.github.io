As a KPOP Dance Club member, I entered for the dance performance.I had learnt ballet for several years at a very young age. However, I had never performed any KPOP dance before that. Nonetheless, I was willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>-  The rehearsal began on a Friday afternoon at a dance studio. The background music for our dance is a very song called swalla. The rhythm of the song was very intense. What’s more, our dance moves were base on one of Lisa (a member of BLACKPINK)’s stage performances. Two seniors were in charge of teaching us the dance. </p>
<p>-  As our rehearsal went on, I started to find it hard to do the dance. No matter how hard I tried , my moves were not as good as the other girls’. Also, I had a terrible memory of the moves. I couldn’t stop to sweat as I felt anxious and tired. However, I still had a very strong desire of greatly performing the dance . This feeling kept running in my<img src="file:///C:\Users\wgy\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.jpg" alt="img"> blood and I couldn’t resist it. I was passionate about dancing. </p>
<p>-  After I went home , I suddenly found a few of bruises on my knees and my straddle. I didn’t even notice that when I was practicing but I suffered from the ache the following days. Meanwhile I spent all of my spare time watching the video of Lisa’s stage performance . She did it perfectly. All her moves looked both smooth and powerful. She really got the rhythm. The way she dealt with her facial expressions was also fantastic. I couldn’t stop watching her dance and try to correct my moves over and over again. I was totally into it. In my opinion,the hardest part of the dance was the move called ‘wave’. It was very challenging for the dancers to control their body properly . So I stared at myself doing this move till I was satisfied with that.</p>
<p>-  Although when the final performance came, I was still not able to do the performance perfectly and we didn’t got the first prize. I enjoyed the total process very much.</p>
<p>-  I have admired the Korean POP dancer and singer Taemin for a very long time. I am fund of watching his dance performances. Before my personal experience of doing the dance performance, I only thought about his perfect move. Now, I start to realize how much effort he had put into his dance practice. That’s why the side he shows to us was always perfect. ‘No victory comes without price.’ The combination of passion and effort is the only way to success.<img src="file:///C:\Users\wgy\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image004.jpg" alt="img"><img src="file:///C:\Users\wgy\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image006.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
