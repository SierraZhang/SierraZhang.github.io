And let us sign up for the roles we wanted to play. The play told a story about a weird and horrible story took place in a medieval village. Briefly it was a immersive play. All the actors and actresses acted as ghosts(NPC) and guide of the haunted house and the audiences were the visitors and players. I read the script and found it very interesting. So I took the role of ghost bride.This is the introduction of our script.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srK3y8"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srK3y8.jpg" alt="srK3y8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>•    One week  before the final show , our drama club started the rehearsal. For the whole week ,we did the rehearsals for about 2 hours a day after school. The rehearsal took place at the senior3 students’ classroom where the haunted house supposed to be .We worked really hard every afternoon. We were all students who had never been in any play before and  we all got a large amount of homework to do after school. And that was the very first time I had a strong realization of balancing the activities and homework. We brainstormed the best ideas of scaring people to make sure the visitors could get the best experience. One day before the final show, the former President of the drama club came to give us some guidance. She is a drama major student at an university abroad currently .She was usually a very friendly person . But when it came to the drama stuff, she immediately became very professional and serious. Her attitude to drama did inspired me a lot that day. She gave us very useful advice and she even did the performance herself as a demonstration. We followed her instructions and found it so much better in that way. As ghost brides ,me and other 3 actresses needed to knock down the table in front of us when the ghost groom said ‘Enjoy your meal’. And we acted like we had been asleep for thousands of years. Then we had to go forward, stumbling, undulating and fast. Then we lunged at the audience, whimpering. It was 7 o’clock in the evening and we all thought we were well prepared.</p>
<h3 id="Final-Performance"><a href="#Final-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Final Performance"></a>Final Performance</h3><p>•    On Oct.14th, we started to do the preparation<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srKIOO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srKIOO.jpg" alt="srKIOO.jpg"></a> for the show at noon. First the make up , which was a very important part of the haunted house actors, was done by a senior 3 student. She did it quite incredible as the make ups were different for different roles. She even dropped the fake blood on our faces to make it as horrible as possible .<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srKIOO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srKIOO.jpg" alt="srKIOO.jpg"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srM0Nd"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srM0Nd.jpg" alt="srM0Nd.jpg"></a>Then, after the set was done , the shows began at 4p.m. when we got the audiences’ list ,we were surprised at the large number of visitors since they needed to pay 5 yuan each for the show. We felt we were very supportive. The show needed to be performed one after another every 15 minutes. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srMB4A"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srMB4A.jpg" alt="srMB4A.jpg"></a>We needed to wait in our red wedding dress and sat in the darkness quite when one turn of visitors left and that was the only time we could rest. The formal show with audiences were quite different from the rehearsal. We needed to adapt ourselves to circumstances. We must act in the way our role should did even when a visitor tried to get close to us without the guidance. And if we found the visitor was not scared , we needed to change our performance immediately . We were all exhausted after the show and I felt my throat was burning since I screamed too much.</p>
<h3 id="Feelings"><a href="#Feelings" class="headerlink" title="Feelings"></a>Feelings</h3><p>•    Nothing is easy if we do treat it seriously. Professional acting is very high-qualified. It really requires a lot of effort to be put in. I really like the way a team does one thing together seriously. I enjoy the feeling of acting. And I was so moved by the professional attitude and I will try to do things in this way. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srMwAH"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srMwAH.jpg" alt="srMwAH.jpg"></a></p>
