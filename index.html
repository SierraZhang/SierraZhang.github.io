        <p>Audition</p>
<p>-  Preparation</p>
<p>•     I have always had a dream about acting since a very young age. At the beginning of this term. We got a chance to choose the club we liked. And for Drama Club , everyone is required to pass the audition for being a club member. Before I had never done the acting in front of many people’s staring eyes. But I did have the strong longing to act. So I decided to give a shot .</p>
<p>•  1 week before the audition, the original club leader sent us the scripts as the<img src="file:///C:\Users\wgy\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image002.jpg" alt="img"> audition’s content .[<a href="#_msocom_1">1]</a> </p>
<p>•  I decided to chose the male role as I wanted to try to transpose. Later ,when I was doing the preparation，I found the content and the spirit of it was quite difficult to understand.I even watched the video of professional actors and actress acting the play. Then I practiced again and again till I think there’s no improvement I could make .However due to the limited time, I didn’t really remember all the words from the scripts when I was about to join the audition.</p>
<p>-  Audition</p>
<p>•  When I entered the audition room, the club leader and a few original club members had already sat there in a big circle waiting for us. I chose a seat to sit down with nervous in my heart. The audition began, the two guys unexpectedly did the brilliant job. They acted without looking at the scripts and acted like the professional actresses who had been in their career for several years. I could sense the emotions and feelings from their acting. Finally they all got very high praise from the club leader. Then it was my turn.All of the sudden, I really felt my heart was about to jump out of my mouth. But I forced myself to calm down and never lose heart. I had to took my scripts with my shaking hand and walked slowly to the middle of the circle. I first bowed and started my acting. It was not that bad as I thought. In the first moment I started to act the first scene，I suddenly calmed down and got into the atmosphere. I acted as I was the man using all his feelings and words to show his<img src="file:///C:\Users\wgy\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image004.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
<p>love to the girl.  The struggled feeling bumped in the air around me. When it came to the second scene, I acted as Romeo in the famous Shakespeare play. It was the self-chosen script and I had to act in English. I was not as good as the two girls before but at least I did my best and didn’t shrink back. The club leader then made her commentary. She said in the first scene, I tried to make the eye contact with the audience and that was a good thing. However in the second scene my English pronunciation was a little bit strange but that was fine because I could take the vocalization exercise in the future. Also, The fact that I wasn’t off scripts affected my performances in someways. I took her suggestions by heart and was grateful for this amazing chance this audition offered.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the script I chose </p>

        <p>What is Dragon Boat Race?**🐲</p>
<p>The dragon boat race is an ancient Chinese folk custom activity and the main custom of the Dragon Boat Festival which is a traditional Han festival. It’s not only a sports and entertainment activity, but also reflects the patriotism and collectivism in people’s hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p>I have never imagined myself attending a dragon boat race. I grow up by the Qinhuai River. Every year, I can watch the race taking place in the river and hear the fierce drums 🥁. I was always impressed by tension made by the race. When the first term just began, school told us we could attend the dragon boat race by passing the selection. That means there was a chance I could finally experience the race by myself. The selection was planned to start at the noon and include push-ups. That required much strength and was especially hard for girls. I tried my best to do the push-ups as much as I could until I was out of breath. And finally, I was told that I made it through the tryouts.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong> </p>
<p>The training took place twice a week on Monday and Thursday. Every training was conducted in the dragon boat on the Qinhuai River where we would take the final race. Every time I start to recall, the scene of our first training still comes to mind like it just happened yesterday. I remembered it was a rainy day ☔. We almost carelessly lost our way to the training place. As soon as we got there, we were all told to put on the life jackets and get on the dragon boat. Since then, we have been a team. All trainings were similar from September to October, but we kept moving forward step by step. I wasn’t absent from any training. We hurried to the riverside after school whatever it was rainy or sunny. Getting on the boat, taking up the quant have been a habit for us. First, we were like spoiled kids. We distained the dirty water 💦 splashed to our face and the boiling action of raising the quant and inserting it into the water. But later, with the encouraging and instructions from our coach. We started to enjoy the trainings. By the time we were going to get into the race, we all felt that we were so ready.</p>
<p><strong>Final race</strong></p>
<p>The final race took place on 2020/10/31. It was a windless, sunny day. Team members from Pre-IB and PAL arrived at the rest area on the river bank at 7:40 a.m. All my families came to see me and I felt so moved and cheerful because of this. We gathered and were told by our leading teacher that since we had participated, we all needed to try our best to exert our greatest strength and we would not regret if we all tried our best. We folded our hands together and claimed to be the best. Also, food and drinks were well prepared for us. The first two race we took part in were not that satisfied because the team was made up temporarily, with people we had never cooperated with. Luckily, all of us didn’t lose our heart and learnt from the failure. That was the time I felt the morale was risen up in the team. We sweared that we would fight it out I the coming five-hundred and two-hundred race. Then we walked to the dragon boat like a group of soldiers ready to fight with extreme peace in our mind. And the life jackets were like our armors. We were cheerful and organized. When our team’s name was called, we shouted out loud 🔊. We shouted with all our might to cheer ourself up and used up all our energy trying to catch up with the boat in front of us. Nobody had time to care about the spray splashed all over the body. And everybody was exhausted as soon as we crossed the final line. That was the first time in life that I finally realized how strong and powerful it could be when everyone’s heart was linked to each other’s in a team. And that’s the beauty of team work. It didn’t really matter what prize we final got since we all tried our best. Actually, we got a first prize and a second prize 🏆. After the race, our leader said to us ‘Today you should feel, what means to stick to the end, and the strength of a team. I hope it can help you in your future 🔮, both study and life.’ </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Our dragon boat team is really good. During the long training period, we all worded together to ride the waves. Specially thanks to our lovely instructor. We were lucky for being the‘worst team’ he hever led. We in the team worked particularly well together, everyone shouted loudly together, paddled together, crossed the line together, it was a bloom moment for us, and it was a great experience, and it was a pleasure to have it. That’s the end.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Voluntary Work at the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing\</em></strong></p>
<p>On October 5th,me and other 3 students from PAL2 went to the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing for the voluntary work. I was chosen to be the <em>team leader</em>. As a leader, I set up a group in QQ which inclueded all our members and posted a range of announcements in it before the activity to make sure the work would be done well.</p>
<p>It was the very first time for me to <em>be a real voluntee</em>r. Before that, I always wondered it could be like to do a voluntary work as I did care about helping the society. We first gathered at the entrance at 8:40a.m. Then, with the excitement and a little bit tension, we <em>Started our journey</em> as volunteers.</p>
<p>After signing in, we got our work from the manager in the volunteer center. That was the time we knew that we needed to work separately in 2 groups, two in each group. One group in needed in the Millennium underground palace. Another one was set in the depositarry of Buddhist texts. I worked in the <em>Millennium underground palace.</em> Then, we put on our yellow work clothes and hurried to our work location.</p>
<p>I worked together with Ye Liu in the palace. The <em>mission we took was to make sure every tourist walked clockwise around the palace according to the Buddhist culture</em>. The work lasted for about 8 hours. So it might be tiring for us .That’s why we decided to take turns to work. Each of us two worked for 1h each turn. Then we exchanged.</p>
<p>At first, we all got lost in the mysterious atmosphere area where Buddhist relics were placed. Meanwhile there wasn’t many tourists in the early morning. So the job seemed not that difficult for us. However, much more tourists started to get into the palace. Only few of them are Buddhist so most of the tourists didn’t realize they should go clockwise around. So we had to stand there still and remind people of the way they should go in a very polite and clear way. After 8 hours’ working, we all got exhausted. <em>But we were also truly happy to see how well-ordered it was due to our voluntary work.</em></p>
<p>That was nearly the <em>most meaningful thing</em> I had ever done for the public. That made me think of how important and difficult it was to make the tourist attractions in good orders. So I will sure to follow the public rules and remind others of this ever since then. And <em>many hands did make light work.</em></p>
