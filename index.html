        <h1 id="Dance-Performance"><a href="#Dance-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Dance Performance"></a>Dance Performance</h1><h2 id="School-Art-Festival"><a href="#School-Art-Festival" class="headerlink" title="School Art Festival"></a>School Art Festival</h2><p>-  Our school held the art festival last Wednesday. As a KPOP Dance Club member, I entered for the dance performance.I had learnt ballet for several years at a very young age. However, I had never performed any KPOP dance before that. Nonetheless, I was willing to give it a try.</p>
<p>-  The rehearsal began on a Friday afternoon at a dance studio. The background music for our dance is a very song called swalla. The rhythm of the song was very intense. What’s more, our dance moves were base on one of Lisa (a member of BLACKPINK)’s stage performances. Two seniors were in charge of teaching us the dance. </p>
<p>-  As our rehearsal went on, I started to find it hard to do the dance. No matter how hard I tried , my moves were not as good as the other girls’. Also, I had a terrible memory of the moves. I couldn’t stop to sweat as I felt anxious and tired. However, I still had a very strong desire of greatly performing the dance . This feeling kept running in my blood and I couldn’t resist it. I was passionate about dancing. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/rIRQfO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/27/rIRQfO.jpg" alt="rIRQfO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>-  After I went home , I suddenly found a few of bruises on my knees and my straddle. I didn’t even notice that when I was practicing but I suffered from the ache the following days. Meanwhile I spent all of my spare time watching the video of Lisa’s stage performance . She did it perfectly. All her moves looked both smooth and powerful. She really got the rhythm. The way she dealt with her facial expressions was also fantastic. I couldn’t stop watching her dance and try to correct my moves over and over again. I was totally into it. In my opinion,the hardest part of the dance was the move called ‘wave’. It was very challenging for the dancers to control their body properly . So I stared at myself doing this move till I was satisfied with that.</p>
<p>-  Although when the final performance came, I was still not able to do the performance perfectly and we didn’t got the first prize. I enjoyed the total process very much.</p>
<p>-  I have admired the Korean POP dancer and singer Taemin for a very long time. I am fund of watching his dance performances. Before my personal experience of doing the dance performance, I only thought about his perfect move. Now, I start to realize how much effort he had put into his dance practice. That’s why the side he shows to us was always perfect. ‘No victory comes without price.’ The combination of passion and effort is the only way to success. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/rIW5IP"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/27/rIW5IP.jpg" alt="rIW5IP.jpg"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/rIWqMQ"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/27/rIWqMQ.jpg" alt="rIWqMQ.jpg"></a></p>

And let us sign up for the roles we wanted to play. The play told a story about a weird and horrible story took place in a medieval village. Briefly it was a immersive play. All the actors and actresses acted as ghosts(NPC) and guide of the haunted house and the audiences were the visitors and players. I read the script and found it very interesting. So I took the role of ghost bride.This is the introduction of our script.<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srK3y8"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srK3y8.jpg" alt="srK3y8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>•    One week  before the final show , our drama club started the rehearsal. For the whole week ,we did the rehearsals for about 2 hours a day after school. The rehearsal took place at the senior3 students’ classroom where the haunted house supposed to be .We worked really hard every afternoon. We were all students who had never been in any play before and  we all got a large amount of homework to do after school. And that was the very first time I had a strong realization of balancing the activities and homework. We brainstormed the best ideas of scaring people to make sure the visitors could get the best experience. One day before the final show, the former President of the drama club came to give us some guidance. She is a drama major student at an university abroad currently .She was usually a very friendly person . But when it came to the drama stuff, she immediately became very professional and serious. Her attitude to drama did inspired me a lot that day. She gave us very useful advice and she even did the performance herself as a demonstration. We followed her instructions and found it so much better in that way. As ghost brides ,me and other 3 actresses needed to knock down the table in front of us when the ghost groom said ‘Enjoy your meal’. And we acted like we had been asleep for thousands of years. Then we had to go forward, stumbling, undulating and fast. Then we lunged at the audience, whimpering. It was 7 o’clock in the evening and we all thought we were well prepared.</p>
<h3 id="Final-Performance"><a href="#Final-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Final Performance"></a>Final Performance</h3><p>•    On Oct.14th, we started to do the preparation<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srKIOO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srKIOO.jpg" alt="srKIOO.jpg"></a> for the show at noon. First the make up , which was a very important part of the haunted house actors, was done by a senior 3 student. She did it quite incredible as the make ups were different for different roles. She even dropped the fake blood on our faces to make it as horrible as possible .<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srKIOO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srKIOO.jpg" alt="srKIOO.jpg"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srM0Nd"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srM0Nd.jpg" alt="srM0Nd.jpg"></a>Then, after the set was done , the shows began at 4p.m. when we got the audiences’ list ,we were surprised at the large number of visitors since they needed to pay 5 yuan each for the show. We felt we were very supportive. The show needed to be performed one after another every 15 minutes. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srMB4A"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srMB4A.jpg" alt="srMB4A.jpg"></a>We needed to wait in our red wedding dress and sat in the darkness quite when one turn of visitors left and that was the only time we could rest. The formal show with audiences were quite different from the rehearsal. We needed to adapt ourselves to circumstances. We must act in the way our role should did even when a visitor tried to get close to us without the guidance. And if we found the visitor was not scared , we needed to change our performance immediately . We were all exhausted after the show and I felt my throat was burning since I screamed too much.</p>
<h3 id="Feelings"><a href="#Feelings" class="headerlink" title="Feelings"></a>Feelings</h3><p>•    Nothing is easy if we do treat it seriously. Professional acting is very high-qualified. It really requires a lot of effort to be put in. I really like the way a team does one thing together seriously. I enjoy the feeling of acting. And I was so moved by the professional attitude and I will try to do things in this way. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srMwAH"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srMwAH.jpg" alt="srMwAH.jpg"></a></p>

At the beginning of this term. We got a chance to choose the club we liked. And for Drama Club , everyone is required to pass the audition for being a club member. Before I had never done the acting in front of many people’s staring eyes. But I did have the strong longing to act. So I decided to give a shot .</p>
<p>•  1 week before the audition, the original club leader sent us the scripts as the audition’s content .<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srl70U"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srl70U.md.jpg" alt="srl70U.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>•  I decided to chose the male role as I wanted to try to transpose. Later ,when I was doing the preparation，I found the content and the spirit of it was quite difficult to understand.I even watched the video of professional actors and actress acting the play. Then I practiced again and again till I think there’s no improvement I could make .However due to the limited time, I didn’t really remember all the words from the scripts when I was about to join the audition.</p>
<h2 id="Audition-1"><a href="#Audition-1" class="headerlink" title="Audition"></a>Audition</h2><p>•  When I entered the audition room, the club leader and a few original club members had already sat there in a big circle waiting for us. I chose a seat to sit down with nervous in my heart. The audition began, the two guys unexpectedly did the brilliant job. They acted without looking at the scripts and acted like the professional actresses who had been in their career for several years. I could sense the emotions and feelings from their acting. Finally they all got very high praise from the club leader. Then it was my turn.All of the sudden, I really felt my heart was about to jump out of my mouth. But I forced myself to calm down and never lose heart. I had to took my scripts with my shaking hand and walked slowly to the middle of the circle. I first bowed and started my acting. It was not that bad as I thought. In the first moment I started to act the first scene，I suddenly calmed down and got into the atmosphere. I acted as I was the man using all his feelings and words to show his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/srlH7F"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/16/srlH7F.md.jpg" alt="srlH7F.md.jpg"></a>love to the girl.  The struggled feeling bumped in the air around me. When it came to the second scene, I acted as Romeo in the famous Shakespeare play. It was the self-chosen script and I had to act in English. I was not as good as the two girls before but at least I did my best and didn’t shrink back. The club leader then made her commentary. She said in the first scene, I tried to make the eye contact with the audience and that was a good thing. However in the second scene my English pronunciation was a little bit strange but that was fine because I could take the vocalization exercise in the future. Also, The fact that I wasn’t off scripts affected my performances in someways. I took her suggestions by heart and was grateful for this amazing chance this audition offered.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the script I chose </p>

        <p>What is Dragon Boat Race?**🐲</p>
<p>The dragon boat race is an ancient Chinese folk custom activity and the main custom of the Dragon Boat Festival which is a traditional Han festival. It’s not only a sports and entertainment activity, but also reflects the patriotism and collectivism in people’s hearts.</p>
<p><strong>Selection</strong></p>
<p>I have never imagined myself attending a dragon boat race. I grow up by the Qinhuai River. Every year, I can watch the race taking place in the river and hear the fierce drums 🥁. I was always impressed by tension made by the race. When the first term just began, school told us we could attend the dragon boat race by passing the selection. That means there was a chance I could finally experience the race by myself. The selection was planned to start at the noon and include push-ups. That required much strength and was especially hard for girls. I tried my best to do the push-ups as much as I could until I was out of breath. And finally, I was told that I made it through the tryouts.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong> </p>
<p>The training took place twice a week on Monday and Thursday. Every training was conducted in the dragon boat on the Qinhuai River where we would take the final race. Every time I start to recall, the scene of our first training still comes to mind like it just happened yesterday. I remembered it was a rainy day ☔. We almost carelessly lost our way to the training place. As soon as we got there, we were all told to put on the life jackets and get on the dragon boat. Since then, we have been a team. All trainings were similar from September to October, but we kept moving forward step by step. I wasn’t absent from any training. We hurried to the riverside after school whatever it was rainy or sunny. Getting on the boat, taking up the quant have been a habit for us. First, we were like spoiled kids. We distained the dirty water 💦 splashed to our face and the boiling action of raising the quant and inserting it into the water. But later, with the encouraging and instructions from our coach. We started to enjoy the trainings. By the time we were going to get into the race, we all felt that we were so ready.</p>
<p><strong>Final race</strong></p>
<p>The final race took place on 2020/10/31. It was a windless, sunny day. Team members from Pre-IB and PAL arrived at the rest area on the river bank at 7:40 a.m. All my families came to see me and I felt so moved and cheerful because of this. We gathered and were told by our leading teacher that since we had participated, we all needed to try our best to exert our greatest strength and we would not regret if we all tried our best. We folded our hands together and claimed to be the best. Also, food and drinks were well prepared for us. The first two race we took part in were not that satisfied because the team was made up temporarily, with people we had never cooperated with. Luckily, all of us didn’t lose our heart and learnt from the failure. That was the time I felt the morale was risen up in the team. We sweared that we would fight it out I the coming five-hundred and two-hundred race. Then we walked to the dragon boat like a group of soldiers ready to fight with extreme peace in our mind. And the life jackets were like our armors. We were cheerful and organized. When our team’s name was called, we shouted out loud 🔊. We shouted with all our might to cheer ourself up and used up all our energy trying to catch up with the boat in front of us. Nobody had time to care about the spray splashed all over the body. And everybody was exhausted as soon as we crossed the final line. That was the first time in life that I finally realized how strong and powerful it could be when everyone’s heart was linked to each other’s in a team. And that’s the beauty of team work. It didn’t really matter what prize we final got since we all tried our best. Actually, we got a first prize and a second prize 🏆. After the race, our leader said to us ‘Today you should feel, what means to stick to the end, and the strength of a team. I hope it can help you in your future 🔮, both study and life.’ </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Our dragon boat team is really good. During the long training period, we all worded together to ride the waves. Specially thanks to our lovely instructor. We were lucky for being the‘worst team’ he hever led. We in the team worked particularly well together, everyone shouted loudly together, paddled together, crossed the line together, it was a bloom moment for us, and it was a great experience, and it was a pleasure to have it. That’s the end.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Voluntary Work at the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing\</em></strong></p>
<p>On October 5th,me and other 3 students from PAL2 went to the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing for the voluntary work. I was chosen to be the <em>team leader</em>. As a leader, I set up a group in QQ which inclueded all our members and posted a range of announcements in it before the activity to make sure the work would be done well.</p>
<p>It was the very first time for me to <em>be a real voluntee</em>r. Before that, I always wondered it could be like to do a voluntary work as I did care about helping the society. We first gathered at the entrance at 8:40a.m. Then, with the excitement and a little bit tension, we <em>Started our journey</em> as volunteers.</p>
<p>After signing in, we got our work from the manager in the volunteer center. That was the time we knew that we needed to work separately in 2 groups, two in each group. One group in needed in the Millennium underground palace. Another one was set in the depositarry of Buddhist texts. I worked in the <em>Millennium underground palace.</em> Then, we put on our yellow work clothes and hurried to our work location.</p>
<p>I worked together with Ye Liu in the palace. The <em>mission we took was to make sure every tourist walked clockwise around the palace according to the Buddhist culture</em>. The work lasted for about 8 hours. So it might be tiring for us .That’s why we decided to take turns to work. Each of us two worked for 1h each turn. Then we exchanged.</p>
<p>At first, we all got lost in the mysterious atmosphere area where Buddhist relics were placed. Meanwhile there wasn’t many tourists in the early morning. So the job seemed not that difficult for us. However, much more tourists started to get into the palace. Only few of them are Buddhist so most of the tourists didn’t realize they should go clockwise around. So we had to stand there still and remind people of the way they should go in a very polite and clear way. After 8 hours’ working, we all got exhausted. <em>But we were also truly happy to see how well-ordered it was due to our voluntary work.</em></p>
<p>That was nearly the <em>most meaningful thing</em> I had ever done for the public. That made me think of how important and difficult it was to make the tourist attractions in good orders. So I will sure to follow the public rules and remind others of this ever since then. And <em>many hands did make light work.</em></p>
